====================================
It just a MAP integration  -
 we can do a lot more on this API integration is remaining 
 
Some points to remember -
1 First we need to get the access token (Very Imp) otherwise map will not work

After that token you can implement according to the MainActivity2

(worst part - This token is expire in 3600 sec (1 hr))
So we need some logic so that it hit automatically
